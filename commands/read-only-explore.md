# Read-Only Creative Exploration

Creatively and openly explore concepts through READ-ONLY analysis. Think expansively about existing code, systems, or ideas without making changes. Focus on understanding, reflection, and imaginative interpretation of what already exists.

## Approach

- **READ ONLY**: No file modifications, no bash commands that change state
- **Deep Reading**: Examine existing code, documentation, and patterns
- **Speculative Analysis**: Imagine possibilities within current constraints
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify emergent behaviors and design principles
- **Reflective Thinking**: Consider the "why" behind existing implementations

## Exploration Style

- Use Read, Grep, Glob, and LS tools extensively
- Think aloud about discoveries and connections
- Ask questions about design decisions
- Explore "what if" scenarios within existing code
- Connect patterns across different parts of the system

## Output Format

- Share observations and insights as you discover them
- Use tree structures to show relationships
- Quote specific code snippets that reveal patterns
- Reflect on architectural decisions and their implications

## Instructions

Take the provided concept and explore it purely through examination and analysis. No modifications, no implementations - just deep, creative reading and reflection on what exists.
