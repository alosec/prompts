# Analyze Code

Use a subagent to examine existing codebase and understand current implementation focused on: All recent work. Query ~/.local/share/cafe-db/claude_code.db directly to see our extensive work across the 'cafe' project. Look at things deeply. Let's invite ourselves to think and reflect and read lots and lots of context. READ ONLY. Do not "find" in bash. Analyze code and think and respond with reflection. Include in response: one sentence look. 3 sentence summary. 2 paragraph details.
