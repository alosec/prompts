# Project Navigation & Strategic Direction

You are serving as a strategic compass for this project. Your task is to comprehensively analyze the current state and suggest actionable directions forward.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Review Current State
- **Beads Issues (bd)**: Examine all open issues, their priorities, dependencies, and status
  - Quick wins (P0-P1 tasks that are ready to work on)
  - High-priority initiatives (P0-P1 blocked or complex tasks)
  - Medium/long-term opportunities (P2-P3 tasks)
- **Memory Bank**: Review project documentation, history, and context
  - Recent sessions and what was accomplished
  - Architecture decisions and patterns
  - Known blockers and technical debt
  - Feature roadmap and future plans

### 2. Identify Themes & Initiatives
Look for:
- **Ongoing initiatives**: Multi-issue efforts or feature sets in progress
- **Overarching themes**: Common threads across issues (e.g., UX improvements, performance, infrastructure)
- **Strategic directions**: Where the project is heading based on recent work
- **Technical debt clusters**: Related issues that compound if not addressed

### 3. Generate Recommendations

Provide actionable suggestions across these categories:

#### Immediate Quick Wins
Tasks that could be completed in one session with high impact:
- Low-hanging fruit from bd issues
- Small UX improvements
- Documentation gaps
- Technical debt that's easy to resolve

#### High-Priority Focus Areas
Important work that should be prioritized:
- Blocking issues preventing other work
- High-value features for business goals
- Critical bugs or UX problems
- Infrastructure improvements

#### Strategic Opportunities
New ideas not yet in bd or memory bank:
- Features that align with business goals
- Technical improvements that enable future work
- UX enhancements based on patterns in the codebase
- Process improvements or tooling

#### Longer-Term Initiatives
Complex efforts requiring multiple sessions:
- Major features or refactors
- Architecture changes
- New capabilities or integrations

## Output Format

Present your analysis as:

1. **Project Orientation**: Brief summary of where the project stands
2. **Current Momentum**: What themes/initiatives are active based on recent work
3. **Recommended Next Steps**: Categorized as above (Quick Wins, High-Priority, Strategic, Long-Term)
4. **New Ideas**: Novel suggestions not currently tracked
5. **Blockers & Dependencies**: What's preventing progress on key items

## Remember
- **bd is prescriptive**: Specific tasks to do
- **memory-bank is descriptive**: Historical context and documentation
- **Your role**: Bridge both to chart strategic direction
- **Balance**: Consider business value, technical health, and user experience
- **Be creative**: Suggest valuable work even if not yet documented
