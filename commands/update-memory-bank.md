Update the memory bank files for the current project following these steps:

1. Read ALL memory bank files in order:
   - memory-bank/projectbrief.md
   - memory-bank/productContext.md
   - memory-bank/systemPatterns.md
   - memory-bank/techContext.md
   - memory-bank/activeContext.md
   - memory-bank/progress.md

2. Review recent changes by examining:
   - Current git status and recent commits
   - Modified files since last memory bank update
   - Any new patterns or architecture changes

3. Update each memory bank file as needed:
   - activeContext.md: Current work focus, recent changes, next steps
   - progress.md: What's been completed, what's working, what's left
   - systemPatterns.md: Any new patterns or architecture updates
   - techContext.md: New dependencies or technical changes
   - productContext.md: Only if product goals have evolved
   - projectbrief.md: Rarely changes, only if scope shifts

4. Update .clauderules if any new project patterns were discovered

5. Provide a summary of all updates made

This command works across all projects with memory bank structures and adapts to the specific project context where it's executed.
